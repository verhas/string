# License3jRepl
Read Eval Print Loop application for License3j library to manage licenses and keys.

This application can be used to create key pairs, create licenses and to sign licenses. The typical workflow is to
create a key pair that will be used to sign and verify licenses. The private key should be stored in some secure place,
like a `.key` directory in your home directory on your machine, or on a USB drive stored in a bank vault. It all
depends on your security needs.

The public key, as it is public can be advertised, but most likely you will embed it into the the code of your
application.
